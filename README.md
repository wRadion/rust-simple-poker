# rust-simple-poker
My first little Rust project: a simple poker console game.

The goal of this project was to practice Rust!
It's not supposed to be used anywhere but take what you want from it!

# Example
An example of a game:
```
Here is your starting hand: (2♢, 2♠, 6♣, 7♡, 9♠)
Would you like to change any cards?
Type the index of the cards you want to change, separated by a comma if many:
2,3
You: (2♢, 2♠, 9♠, 3♣, Q♡) => Pair of 2
 Me: (3♠, 8♡, 10♡, 9♣, 4♢) => HighestCard of 10
You win! Congrats!
```

# How to use
Run the crate using:
```
cargo run
```
